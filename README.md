In this project I used Javascript, MySQL, and DBeaver. I also created an ERD for the database using one to many and many to many relationships. This project is a menu driven application. I used Eclipse to program the project. I created a Maven Project Directory and sql.files. I added the MySQL driver as a dependency to the POM file, used packages to seperate project concerns. I wrote Java code to connect to the MySQL database and schema.  I used JDBC to connect to the MySQL database, implemeted a scanner and worked with BigDecimal objects. Any issues were resolved before posting this project to the respository. I used SQL to query by writing statements to fetch a list of Project records, using one statement to perform multiple queries. I practiced using Lamda expressions and to throw a custom Exception for an optional.
